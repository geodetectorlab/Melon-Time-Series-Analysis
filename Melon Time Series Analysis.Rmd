## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```



```{r}
melon = read.csv(file.choose())

attach(melon)

class(melon)

head(melon)
melon
```


```{r}
melon_ts = ts(melon$yield, start = 1390, end = 1399, frequency = 29)
melon_ts
plot(melon_ts, xlab = "Yield over years",  ylab = "Rate of yield harvested", main = "Timeseries Analysis of Melon from 1390-1399")
```



```{r}
melon_ts = ts(melon$suntime, start = 1390, end = 1399, frequency = 29)
melon_ts
plot(melon_ts, xlab = "Suntime over years",  ylab = "Sun Duration", main = "Timeseries Analysis of Melon's suntime  from 1390-1399")
```



```{r}
attach(melon)
melon_ts = ts(cbind(suntime, press.mean, humean, meant, yield), start = 1390, end = 1399, frequency = 29)
melon_ts
plot(melon_ts, xlab = "Yield over years", main = "Timeseries Analysis of Melon from 1390-1399")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
